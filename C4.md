# Functions and program structure

### Functions

Each function definition has the general form

```
return_type function_name(input_type variable_name)
{
    /* something happens here */
}
```

```c
int addNumbers(int number1, int number2)
{
    int sum = number1 + number2;
    return sum;
}
```

1. Variable
    * The variable names in the function
definition do not have to match
the names in the function call.
    * We would declare variables in our function.
    * We would call other functions in
our function.
1. Return
    * We would use `return` keyword to return
a value.
    * We would use `void` if we are not passing or not
returning anything.
    * We can pass or receive
any types of variables.
1. Arrays
    * We can pass arrays to
    functions just as we do
    with other variable types.
    * There is a significant difference
    between passing variables to
    functions and passing arrays to functions.
        * When passing a cariable by value,
        a copy of the variable is used in the function.
        The changes to the variables will not affect the original.
        * When passing an array to a function,
        we are actually passing the address of the array.
        The changes to the array will affect the original.
    * When passing 2D arrays as paramerters, the number of the
    columus is required.
1. Declarations
    * Function code would be before `main`.
    * Function declaration would be before `main`.
1. Including functions
    * To use functions in the Standard C
    Library `stdio.h`.
    * We could place our
    own functions in their own
    file and use them in our programs

### Variable scope

* Scope
    - Visibility of variable.
* Local variable
    - Variables declared within a function block are local variables and they are known only to that function.
    - Variables declared outside the function are unknown to the function.
* Global variable
    - A global variable is a variable that is declared outside all functions.
    - The scope of a global variable is the file. All functions can use the global variable.      
    - Let's say that the first function is main() and additional functions are defined after main(). The variables declared above main() are global variables.
    - Access a global variable in another file `extern`.      



### Swap Function      

```c      
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int tmp;
    tmp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = tmp;

}

void swapWithoutTemp(int *a, int *b) {
    *a = *a ^ *b;
    *b = *a ^ *b;
    *a = *a ^ *b;
//    *b = *a ^ *b;
//    *a = *a ^ *b;
//    *b = *a ^ *b;

}

int main() {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
//    // Swap
//    // Declare tmp and store a to tmp
//    int tmp;
//    tmp = a;
//    // Copy b to a
//    a = b;
//    // Copy tmp to b
//    b = tmp;
//    printf("a %d, b %d", a, b);

//    swap(&a, &b);
    swapWithoutTemp(&a, &b);
    printf("a %d, b %d", a, b);

}
