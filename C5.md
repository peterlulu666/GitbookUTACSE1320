### Array

1. Array is a variable that can hold more than one value.
2. We would define an array of size 10 `int a[10]`.
    1. The array `a[10]` will hold 10 integer numbers.
    2. We could provide the specific array values `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 2`, etc.
    3. We would also declare and initialize the array at the same time `int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`.
3. The first element of the array is `a[0]`, the second element is `a[1]`, etc.

4. Let's say that `aptr` is the pointer to the integer `a[0]`, declared as `int *aptr;`.
    1. `aptr = &a[0]` is the address of `a[0]`.
    2. `*aptr` is the contents of `a[0]`.
    3. `aptr + i` is the address of `a[i]`.
    4. `*(aptr + i)` is the contents of `a[i]`.

> **[info] Array**
>* Each element of the array will be of the same type.
>* Array indices began at 0.
>* The initialized values will be at the beginning of the array.
>* The remaining values will be initialized to zero.

<br/>

> **[warning] Array out of bounds **
>* A common error is the “array out of bounds” error that occurs when the index goes beyond the declared size.
>* The value outside the assigned range will be changed.

### Multidimensional Arrays

1. 2D array
    * `int a[rows][columns] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };`
2. 3D array
    * `int a[][][];`

> **[warning] 1D and 2D arrays differences **

>When declaring a 2D array, the number of columns is required.
